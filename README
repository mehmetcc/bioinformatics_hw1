If you want to test the program with example data, type in make,
and then run by ./main

If you want to give examples with files, use make, and after that
type in ./main <TEXT_FILE.fa> <PATTERN_FILE.fa>

There are several bash scripts which are unnecessary for the TA but
I used them for to manage git and reduce boilerplate
